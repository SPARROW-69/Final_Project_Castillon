            As you can see in the above picture, that is my Mother. She is a very kind and hardworking woman. 
            She’s doing her best to take care of all of us. She never tired of being a mother to us even though all of us are 
            almost arguing every day. The characteristic that I really love about her is that she is very kind. 
            She will really give the thing that she knows she can give you like for example there is a someone who will borrow a 
            money from her but she has no money to lend, but all she will do is, she will be the one who will borrow from others 
            just to give to you. I know that the borrower won't pay anymore to her, so in the end, my mother was the one who had 
            the debt. This kind of characteristic that my mother possesses is that sometimes I get annoyed with her. 
            Moving on and the most important part is that I would like to tell her how thankful I am to be her daughter.
            She is doing everything the best way possible for my life and to my siblings. I hope that she lives 
            really long because I don't know what I would do if she were gone. I will always be there every step of 
            the way, through thick and thin. I can't even tell her but ma “I Love you, you're a great mother!"
